# Diabetes Prediction Project

## Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of diabetes based on various clinical features. The model utilizes the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains clinical data of women of Pima Indian heritage aged 21 years or older. The dataset includes eight clinical features and one target variable indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. Missing values have been replaced with the mean of their respective columns.

## Algorithm Used
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is employed for this project. It is a simple yet effective classification algorithm that considers the k nearest neighbors to make predictions.

## Data Visualization
Bar charts and correlation matrices are used to visualize the relationship between age and diabetes, as well as the correlation between different features.

## Result Analysis
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-measure, specificity, false positive rate, false negative rate, negative predictive value, false discovery rate, and Matthews's correlation coefficient. The model's performance is compared across different train-test split ratios.

## Evaluation
The evaluation indicates that a higher ratio of training data results in better performance for the model.

## Conclusion
This project provides a machine learning-based tool to predict diabetes based on clinical features. It can assist healthcare professionals in early identification of diabetes and provide personalized care. Users can also assess their risk of developing diabetes and take preventive measures.
